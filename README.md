<h1 align = "center">Rymn is a program that is inspired by Anki, WaniKani, and Bunpro, as well as many other SRS based learning programs.<br><br>Rymn supports multiple languages being studied at a time, so the sky is the limit!</h1>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<h3><ins>Part 1: Installing Node</ins></h3>
<em>Please note to run this program you will need to install node.</em> Go to the prebuilt installer section to get an easy install.<br>
This is a common Javascript dependency for many programs to run! <u>Here is the link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager. </u>
<br>
Just leave the settings on default for the install and click next until you reach finish! 
<h3><ins>Part 2: Downloading the Zip</ins></h3>
To use rymn, download the repository as a ZIP file (click on Code near the top of the repository and press the 'download as ZIP option'). <br>Unzip it and store it somewhere for easy access.
<br>
<h3><ins>Part 3: Running Setup Once</ins></h3>
After that, navigate into the frontend folder, within that folder right click on an open space and press "open in terminal". In the terminal type these commands <em><u>one at a time</u></em>:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm install serve
```

<br>
<strong><ins>Please note: <em>npm install</em> may take some time to run and might look like it's frozen, this is completely normal, please allow it to finish.</ins></strong>

<h1>Normal Usage</h1>
After the installation we can use the program normally to do this run the <em>run_program</em> file in the <em>frontend</em> folder to use rymn as you please!

When you open the <em>run_program</em> file in the front end folder, it will open two command prompts each running a server (so don't worry if windows pop up :D ). One of them will have localhost:(some number). If you control click that (localhost:(some number)) it will open the program!

<h1>About Rymn</h1>
Rymn uses specific review timings for terms to make them stick. These timing are research based and go in the order of <br>
<hr>
Level 1: 4 hours<br>
Level 2: 8 hours<br>
Level 3: 1 day<br>
Level 4: 2 days<br>
Level 5: 1 week<br>
Level 6: 2 weeks<br>
Level 7: 1 Month<br>
Level 8: 4 Months<br>
<hr>
If you get the term correct when reviewing on the <ins>first try</ins> then it will level up, otherwise it move down some levels depending on a formula.

I hope you are able to utilize this program to advance your learning journeys, thank you!
