```
npm install
npm run build
npm install serve
```

<br>
<strong><ins>Please note: <em>npm install</em> may take some time to run and might look like it's frozen, this is completely normal, please allow it to finish.</ins></strong>

<h1>Normal Usage</h1>
After the installation we can use the program normally to do this run the <em>run_program</em> file in the <em>frontend</em> folder to use as you please!

When you open the <em>run_program</em> file in the front end folder, it will open two command prompts each running a server (so don't worry if windows pop up). One of them will have localhost:(some number). If you hold control and click that (localhost:(some number)) it will open the program!

<h1>About </h1>
Rymn uses specific review timings for terms to make them stick. These timing are research based and go in the order of <br>
<hr>
Level 1: 4 hours<br>
Level 2: 8 hours<br>
Level 3: 1 day<br>
Level 4: 2 days<br>
Level 5: 1 week<br>
Level 6: 2 weeks<br>
Level 7: 1 Month<br>
Level 8: 4 Months<br>
<hr>
If you get the term correct when reviewing on the <ins>first try</ins> then it will level up, otherwise it move down some levels depending on a formula.

I hope you are able to utilize this program to advance your learning journeys, thank you!
