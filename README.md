<h1>Rymn is a program that is inspired by Anki, WaniKani, and Bunpro, as well as many other SRS based learning programs. It takes my favorite features from WaniKani which is the level based review timings and adds that to something that can be used for any language learner of any language. The program also runs locally, meaning you can use it with or without wifi.
The program runs with profiles, each of these representing a language. Rymn supports multiple languages being studied at a time, so the sky is the limit!</h1>
<h2>
Here are the steps to run it:
Please note to run this program you will need to install node. This is a common Javascript dependency for many programs to run! Here is the link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager. Go to the prebuilt installer section to get an easy install.
</h2>
To use this, download the repository as a ZIP file. Unzip it and store it somewhere for easy access. After that, navigate into the frontend folder and right click on a open space to get to "open in terminal". In the terminal type these commands one at a time (only needs to be done once):
```
npm install
npm run build
npm install serve
```

npm install may take a while to run and might look like it's frozen, this is completely normal, please allow it to finish.

Afterwards you may run the run_program file in the frontend folder to use rymn as you please!

When you open the run_program file in the front end folder, it will open two command prompts each running a server (so don't worry if windows pop up :D ). One of them will have localhost:(some number). If you control click that it will open the program!

Thank you for using Rymn! I wish you the best of luck on your learning journeys!
